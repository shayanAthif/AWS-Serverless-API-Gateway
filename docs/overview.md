# Serverless API Gateway

### What Are We Doing?

We are going to be creating a serverless API for managing database records using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**.

Specifically, we'll build a cloud-based system that allows users to:  
- **Create** new database entries  
- **Read** existing records  
- **Update** data  
- **List** all entries
